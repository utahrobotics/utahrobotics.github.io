Main purpose of the post:
- Good history keeping.  Remembering and documenting the past
- Give others (new members, sponsors, other parties) a good intro to the what the team is about
- Tells a story of the team.  Interesting to see the origins and progression


This post goes over the history of our results in the competition, and how the
team and robot design has changed over the years.



# The Beginning




2014-15. beginning of the team.  Mining engineer, John Robe, and Dave.

The Utah Student Robotics club started with the main purpose of competing
in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition.  It was started as the Utah Robotic
Mining Project; while the name was appropriate to the competition, it didn't
sell as well (footnote, we seemed to get way more people interested with the
name change.  people don't care for mining as much as I guess)
and didn't support any expansion.

## Why sponsor Utah Student Robotics?

**Practicals**<br>
We will put your logo on our robot and on our booth at the competition,
where many NASA staff and 50 other universities will see it. <br>
**Ideals**<br>
This project is an investment in the future of engineering and robotics.
Students on the team learn practical engineering skills that make them better
prepared to join the work force.  They also get to study and research cutting
edge methods in robotics.

#### How is the money used?

We use donations from sponsors to purchase parts for the robot (motors,
computers, metal) and for travel costs to the competition at Kennedy Space
Center, Florida.

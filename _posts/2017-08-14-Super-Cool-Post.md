The rules have been updated this year for the NASA Robotic Mining Competition.
New this year is the rule that BP-1 is no longer worth any points. In order to qualify,
teams must collect at least 1kg of gravel. The gravel is located 30cm below the surface of BP-1.

See below for the key points from the rules. The hope is that it will be easier to
skim through the bullet points below rather than reading the full rules.

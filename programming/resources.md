# Running Linux

* Download VMWare to run a virtual machine
  * [U of U VMWare Login](https://www.eng.utah.edu/vmware/)
  * If on Windows: download VMWare Workstation 12
  * If on Mac: download VMware Fusion
  * If on Linux but not running Ubuntu: download VMWare Workstation 12
* Download Ubuntu 16.04 LTS .iso
  * [Download page](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

  * Use the file you downloaded above as the installer disk image
  * Minimum Recommended Settings:
    * 2 CPU cores
    * 4 GB of RAM
    * 40 GB of Hard Drive (HD) space
    * 3D acceleration enabled
* Most ROS utilities use the command line. Open this by pressing the circle icon in the top left and typing in `terminal`.
  * The terminal is also accessable by typing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>
  * It is recommended that you lock the terminal to the side bar by right clicking on the icon and selecting 'Lock to Launcher'.
